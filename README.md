# 👋 Hi! I'm Jakub Grzyb

👋 Hi! I’m a 3rd-year Computer Science and Intelligent Systems student at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. My studies focus on programming, data analysis, data engineering, machine learning, and web development, equipping me with a strong foundation in modern technologies. 🖥️

⚙️ I’m passionate about software development, artificial intelligence, and game creation. As a member of the [Code Industry](http://coin.agh.edu.pl/) scientific circle, I collaborate on game development projects. 🎮

🔧 I continuously enhance my skills through personal projects, programming courses and challanges, and participation in hackathons and game jams. I enjoy exploring new technologies and turning ideas into impactful solutions. 🚀
